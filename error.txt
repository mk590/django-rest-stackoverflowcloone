Reverse accessor 'Question.comments' for 'stackoverflow.Acomment.answer' clashes with reverse accessor for 'stackoverflow.QComment.question'.
        HINT: Add or change a related_name argument to the definition for 'stackoverflow.Acomment.answer' or 'stackoverflow.QComment.question'.

Django automatically creates reverse accessors for relationships, and if two or more relationships have the same default reverse accessor name, you'll get a clash.

sol unique related names 

indention mistake are very fatal 

not able to save the author while doing in the views to save the author by request.user 
resolved by removing the logic from the views and adding it to the serializer itself 
try to consolidate the logic at a single place 
django mein no serializer so waha par views mein 
yaha par serializer mein 
jo request aa rahi wo serializer ke pass ja rahi before going to the models for saving so serializer ko cutomize kar diya 
serializer hi request meinse user nikal kar save kar lega
